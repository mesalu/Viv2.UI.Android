Android UI for viv2 project.


## Architecture

I'm currently trying to follow the android suggested-architecture presented[here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide). As of writing this part of the README, the respository layers aren't much more than pass throughs to Retrofit, but ideally I'll get local caching via Room in before finishing the app.
